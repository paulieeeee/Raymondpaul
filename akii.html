    <h1>The Story in the Book</h1>
    <hr>
    <h2>Chapter 1</h2>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Molly had been staring out of her window for about an hour now. On her desk, lying between the copies of 
    <i>Nature</i>, <i>New Scientist</i>, and all other scientific journals her work had appeared in, was a well-thumbed copy of <cite>On The Road</cite>. 
    It had been Molly's favourite book since college, and the longer she spent in these four walls, the more she felt she needed to be free.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She had spent the last ten years in this room, sitting under a poster with an Oscar Wilde quote proclaiming that 
    <q>Work is the refuge of people who having nothing to do</q>. Although many considered her pioneering work, unraveling secrets of llama 
    <abbr title="Deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</abbr>, to be an outstanding achievement, Molly <em>did</em> think she had something better to do.</p>
